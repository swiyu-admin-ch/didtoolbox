# workflows

This configuration directory containing various YAML files describing GitHub Actions workflows,
as advised [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/get-started/understanding-github-actions#workflows):

_A workflow is a configurable automated process that will run one or more jobs.
Workflows are defined by a YAML file checked in to your repository and will run when triggered by an event in your repository,
or they can be triggered manually, or at a defined schedule._

This repo features the following workflows:
