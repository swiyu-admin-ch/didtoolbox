| 2.1.2   | **IMPROVEMENT**: [`jsonschema`](src/embed/jsonschema) (e-ID-conform only) relaxed a bit for the sake of backward compatibility with some legacy (rather ancient) versions of [DID Toolbox (Java)](https://github.com/swiyu-admin-ch/didtoolbox-java)                                       |

| 2.0.0   | **BREAKING CHANGE**: Both `TrustDidWebId::parse_did_tdw` and `TrustDidWeb::read` constructors have been simplified thus supporting no `allow_http` flag anymore. Various **security fixes** implemented and overall **error handling** enhancements introduced.                            |
| 1.0.1   | **IMPROVEMENT/FIX (security)**: Rectify faulty proof verification for DID log updates. It fixes a faulty proof verification that allowed to use updateKeys contained in a to be added DID log line for generating valid proofs. Proper error handling (no panics) impl. across all modules |
| 1.0.0   | **IMPROVEMENT/FIX** Cleanup. Fixed interop issue. Final attempt to ensure conformity with [Trust DID Web - did:tdw - v0.3](https://identity.foundation/trustdidweb/v0.3/) - Only required Resolver parts                                                                                   |

| 0.0.4   | **FEATURE** Non-empty constructor added for `TrustDidWeb`. Code formatted using `rustfmt`                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 0.0.3   | **BREAKING CHANGE** `TrustDidWebProcessor` discontinued. <br/>Signature of the `read` method now also requires a DID log (as string).<br/> All `TrustDidWeb` methods may now throw new `TrustDidWebError`                                                                                  |
