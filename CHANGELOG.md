| 1.0.1   | **IMPROVEMENT/FIX (security)**: Rectify faulty proof verification for DID log updates. It fixes a faulty proof verification that allowed to use updateKeys contained in a to be added DID log line for generating valid proofs. Proper error handling (no panics) impl. across all modules |
| 1.0.0   | **IMPROVEMENT/FIX** Cleanup. Fixed interop issue. Final attempt to ensure conformity with [Trust DID Web - did:tdw - v0.3](https://identity.foundation/trustdidweb/v0.3/) - Only required Resolver parts                                                                                   |

| 0.0.3   | **BREAKING CHANGE** `TrustDidWebProcessor` discontinued. <br/>Signature of the `read` method now also requires a DID log (as string).<br/> All `TrustDidWeb` methods may now throw new `TrustDidWebError`                                                                                  |
